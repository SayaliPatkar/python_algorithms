    "# Insertion Sort\n",
    " \n",
    "This sorting algorithm divides the array in two sections : sorted and unsorted. In each iteration, new element is inserted in sorted section from unsorted section. Inside the sorted section, the new element has to find it's optimal position to keep the sorted section sorted. \n",

    "### Time Complexities\n",
    "##### Worst Case Complexity: O(n2)\n",
    "    If we want to sort in ascending order and the array is in descending order then the worst case occurs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Best Case Complexity: O(n)\n",
    "    When the array is already sorted, the outer loop runs for n number of times whereas the inner loop does not run at all. So, there are only n number of comparisons. Thus, complexity is linear.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Average Case Complexity: O(n2)\n",
    "    It occurs when the elements of the array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).\n",

    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "    Space complexity is O(1) if an extra variable is used for current_min. "
