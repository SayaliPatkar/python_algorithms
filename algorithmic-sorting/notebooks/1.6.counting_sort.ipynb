    "# Counting Sort\n",
    " \n",
    "Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements of an integer array containing multiple occurrences of same elements. Sorting is done by counting the number of occurrences of each unique element in the array. The count is stored in an auxiliary array and the sorting is done by mapping the count as an index of the auxiliary array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming array is of length n and consists of k unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "If array is of positive integers, auxiliary array could be array where index represents main array's element and auxiliary element is number of occurrences of that main array's element. This auxiliary array could later be concerted to \"cumulative\" count array. Which is ultimately used for sorting.\n",

    "In case of negative integer array, auxiliary array relations could be more challenging as now index could NOT represent main array's element anymore.\n",
