    "## Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all dynamic solutions work in the same way. \n",
    "Some are built bottom-up while others are built top-down. \n",
    "The distinction can be found in how each begins a problem and how sub-problem results are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom-up dynamic programming solutions start by looking at the smallest possible sub-problem, \n",
    "called the base case, and then works step-by-step up to each sub-problem. As each sub-problem \n",
    "is solved, its solution is saved and used to solve the next lowest sub-problem. In the end, \n",
    "these building solutions will lead to an answer to the main problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tabulation\n",
    "Tabulation is the process of storing results of sub-problems from a bottom-up approach sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tabulation, we donâ€™t pick and choose which sub-problems need to be solved and instead solve every sub-problem between the base case and the main problem. This sequential order lends tabulation to use either lists or array, as those collections organize information in a specific order."
